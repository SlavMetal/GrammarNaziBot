# GrammarNaziBot
GrammarNaziBot is a Telegram bot that checks grammar of every message sent in private or group chat. Recognizes English, Russian and Ukrainian words using Yandex Speller API.
## Setup

    ```Bash
    git clone https://github.com/SlavMetal/GrammarNaziBot
    ```
1. Install required packages:
    ```Bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
1. Replace sample data in config.yml with the real one: bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), administrators IDs (required for some functions) and groups IDs where the bot will be used (or leave it blank to allow all groups).
